	abstract = {Aim: nlmixr offers first-order conditional estimation with or without interaction ({FOCE} or {FOCEi}) and stochastic approximation estimation-maximisation ({SAEM}) to fit nonlinear mixed-effect models ({NLMEM}). We modelled metformin’s population pharmacokinetics with flip-flop characteristics within nlmixr framework and investigated {SAEM} and {FOCEi}’s performance with respect to bias, precision, and robustness. Method: Compartmental pharmacokinetic models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the lowest objective function value and visual inspection of goodness-of-fit plots. To examine flip-flop pharmacokinetics, k\_a values of a typical concentration-time profile based on the final model were perturbed and changes in the steepness of the terminal elimination phase were evaluated. The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between {SAEM} and {FOCEi} using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100-times and resultant changes evaluated. Results: A one-compartment model with transit compartment for absorption best described the data. At low n, Stirling’s approximation of n! over-approximated plasma concentration unlike the log-gamma function. Flip-flop pharmacokinetics were evident as the steepness of the terminal elimination phase changed with k\_a. Mean {rRMSE} for fixed-effect parameters was 0.932. When initial estimates were perturbed, {FOCEi} estimates of k\_a and food effect on k\_a appeared bimodal and were upward biased. Discussion: nlmixr is reliable for {NLMEM} even if flip-flop is present but caution should be exercised when using Stirling’s approximation for n! in the transit compartment model. {SAEM} was marginally superior to {FOCEi} in bias and precision, but {SAEM} was superior against initial estimate perturbations.},

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated {SAEM} and {FOCEi}'s performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates.

The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between {SAEM} and {FOCEi} using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. Results The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status. Under the fasted state, the first-order absorption into the central compartment was preceded by zero-order infusion into the depot compartment, whereas for the fed state, the absorption into the depot was instantaneous followed by first-order absorption from depot into the central compartment. The means of relative mean estimation error ({rMEE}) ( {MEESAEMMEEFOCEi}) and {rRMSE} ( {RMSESAEMRMSEFOCEi}) were 0.48 and 0.35, respectively. All parameter estimates given by {SAEM} appeared to be narrowly distributed and were close to the true value used for simulation. In contrast, the distribution of estimates from {FOCEi} were skewed and more biased. When initial estimates were perturbed, {FOCEi} estimates were more biased and imprecise. Discussion nlmixr is reliable for {NLMEM}. {SAEM} was superior to {FOCEi} in terms of bias and precision, and more robust against initial estimate perturbations.},

	abstract = {Pharmacometric analyses of time series viral load data may detect drug effects with greater power than approaches using single time points. Because {SARS}-{CoV}-2 viral load rapidly rises and then falls, viral dynamic models have been used. We compared different modelling approaches when analysing Phase {II}-type viral dynamic data. Using two {SARS}-{CoV}-2 datasets of viral load starting within 7 days of symptoms, we fitted the slope-intercept exponential decay ({SI}), reduced target cell limited ({rTCL}), target cell limited ({TCL}) and {TCL} with eclipse phase ({TCLE}) models using nlmixr. Model performance was assessed via Bayesian information criterion ({BIC}), visual predictive checks ({VPCs}), goodness-of-fit plots, and parameter precision. The most complex ({TCLE}) model had the highest {BIC} for both datasets. The estimated viral decline rate was similar for all models except the {TCL} model for dataset A with a higher rate (median [range] day−1: dataset A; 0.63 [0.56–1.84]; dataset B: 0.81 [0.74–0.85]). Our findings suggest simple models should be considered during pharmacodynamic model development.},
