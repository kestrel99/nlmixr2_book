@article{Almquist2015,
abstract = {The first order conditional estimation (FOCE) method is still one of the parameter estimation workhorses for nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) modeling used in population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. However, because this method involves two nested levels of optimizations, with respect to the empirical Bayes estimates and the population parameters, FOCE may be numerically unstable and have long run times, issues which are most apparent for models requiring numerical integration of differential equations. We propose an alternative implementation of the FOCE method, and the related FOCEI, for parameter estimation in NLME models. Instead of obtaining the gradients needed for the two levels of quasi-Newton optimizations from the standard finite difference approximation, gradients are computed using so called sensitivity equations. The advantages of this approach were demonstrated using different versions of a pharmacokinetic model defined by nonlinear differential equations. We show that both the accuracy and precision of gradients can be improved extensively, which will increase the chances of a successfully converging parameter estimation. We also show that the proposed approach can lead to markedly reduced computational times. The accumulated effect of the novel gradient computations ranged from a 10-fold decrease in run times for the least complex model when comparing to forward finite differences, to a substantial 100-fold decrease for the most complex model when comparing to central finite differences. Considering the use of finite differences in for instance NONMEM and Phoenix NLME, our results suggests that significant improvements in the execution of FOCE are possible and that the approach of sensitivity equations should be carefully considered for both levels of optimization.},

abstract = {In pharmacometrics, we try to understand how the dose of a drug and measurable attributes of patients influence their drug concentration-time profiles, and to relate drug concentration-time profiles and patient attributes to the time profile of drug effects. Using this information, we can use tools like "nlmixr" to try to identify the right dose for the right patient. Our discipline is a fusion of pharmacol-ogy, physiology, and quantitative sciences, such as statistics. Statistical methods commonly practiced in the analysis of clinical studies often utilize linear mixed models to investigate trial outcomes. The characterization of longitudinal concentration and drug effect in pharmacometrics extends this statistical paradigm to include nonlinear models, which are often based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These ODEs are required to describe complex systems affecting concentrations and effects of drugs that often cannot be described by simple linear models. Nonlinear models can be fitted using the statistical language R 1 with its included "nlme" package. The nlme package allows the expression of nonlinear functions in R and fitting these models in a nonlinear mixed effect (NLME) modeling statistical framework. Only nonlinear equations with closed-form solutions can be used, however, and if more than one dose is administered to a patient, these equations quickly become extremely complex. The nlmixr package 2 extends nlme by providing the ability to add flexible individual-based dosing regimens, and to describe the models using both ODEs and solved systems when these are available. The nlmixr package has made these ODEs easy to express by using Leibniz notation (see below). To run the model, one specifies the ODE/solved system and provides initial estimates for the model as described in the nlmixr tuto-rial. 2 The model then can be solved using the nlme algorithm, or, more optimally, using more advanced algorithms that have been shown to provide more accurate parameter estimates like first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) 3 and stochastic approximation expectation maximization (SAEM). 3 Statisticians who are familiar with nlme and are becoming familiar with population pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) may thus find it relatively straightforward to transition from nlme to more robust methodologies and more complex models and data structures. An example of nlmixr applied to a simple PK system serves to illustrate the uncomplicated syntax and how a transition to more complex and robust NLME methodologies might be accomplished without leaving the familiar R environment. Theophylline is used to inhibit phosphodiesterase and is used as treatment in many respiratory diseases. The analysis of the theophylline dataset of Dr. Upton 4 is one of the most common introductory applications of NLME modeling, and is a common introductory dataset for learning nlme (it is included in the base R distribution as the Theoph and reformatted and supplied in nlmixr as theo_sd and extrapolated to multiple doses with theo_ md). If a single dose is given at time zero, the equations can be expressed as the closed-form solution to a one-compartment oral absorption system, and analyzed using nlme. In the syntax of nlmixr, fitting of the theophylline PK can be specified as: This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited and is not used for commercial purposes.},

Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size ε and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter ε on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

Neglecting IOV also results in a high incidence of statistically significant spurious period effects. Perhaps most important, ignoring IOV can lead to a falsely optimistic impression of the potential value of therapeutic drug monitoring. A model incorporating IOV was developed and its performance in the presence and absence of IOV was evaluated. The IOV model performs well with respect to both model selection and population parameter estimation in all circumstances studied. Analysis of two real data examples using this model reveals significant IOV in all parameters for both drugs and supports the simulation findings for the case that IOV is ignored: predictable biases occur in parameter estimates and previously nonexistent period effects are found.},

	abstract = {Whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are increasingly used in drug development for their ability to predict drug concentrations in clinically relevant tissues and to extrapolate across species, experimental conditions and sub-populations. A whole-body PBPK model can be fitted to clinical data using a Bayesian population approach. However, the analysis might be time consuming and numerically unstable if prior information on the model parameters is too vague given the complexity of the system. We suggest an approach where (i) a whole-body PBPK model is formally reduced using a Bayesian proper lumping method to retain the mechanistic interpretation of the system and account for parameter uncertainty, (ii) the simplified model is fitted to clinical data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques and (iii) the optimised reduced PBPK model is used for extrapolation. A previously developed 16-compartment whole-body PBPK model for mavoglurant was reduced to 7 compartments while preserving plasma concentration-time profiles (median and variance) and giving emphasis to the brain (target site) and the liver (elimination site). The reduced model was numerically more stable than the whole-body model for the Bayesian analysis of mavoglurant pharmacokinetic data in healthy adult volunteers. Finally, the reduced yet mechanistic model could easily be scaled from adults to children and predict mavoglurant pharmacokinetics in children aged from 3 to 11 years with similar performance compared with the whole-body model. This study is a first example of the practicality of formal reduction of complex mechanistic models for Bayesian inference in drug development.Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this article (doi:10.1208/s12248-015-9840-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.},

	abstract = {This article describes the population pharmacokinetics of rifampin in South African pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Three datasets containing 2,913 rifampin plasma concentration-time data points, collected from 261 South African pulmonary tuberculosis patients aged 18 to 72 years and weighing 28.5 to 85.5 kg and receiving regular daily treatment that included administration of rifampin (450 to 600 mg) for at least 10 days, were pooled. A compartmental pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Variability in the shape of the absorption curve was described using a flexible transit compartment model, in which a delay in the onset of absorption and a gradually changing absorption rate were modeled as the passage of drug through a chain of hypothetical compartments, ultimately reaching the absorption compartment. A previously described implementation was extended to allow its application to multiple-dosing data. The typical population estimate of oral clearance was 19.2 liters·h-1, while the volume of distribution was estimated to be 53.2 liters. Interindividual variability was estimated to be 52.8\% for clearance and 43.4\% for volume of distribution. Interoccasional variability was estimated for CL/F (22.5\%) and mean transit time during absorption (67.9\%). The use of single-drug formulations was found to increase both the mean transit time (by 104\%) and clearance (by 23.6\%) relative to fixed-dose-combination use. A strong correlation between clearance and volume of distribution suggested substantial variability in bioavailability, which could have clinical implications, given the dependence of treatment effectiveness on exposure. The final model successfully described rifampin pharmacokinetics in the population studied and is suitable for simulation in this context. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Purpose: To compare the performance of the standard lag time model (LAG model) with the performance of an analytical solution of the transit compartment model (TRANSIT model) in the evaluation of four pharmacokinetic studies with four different compounds. Methods: The population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using NONMEM on concentration-time data of glibenclamide, furosemide, amiloride, and moxonidine. In the TRANSIT model, the optimal number of transit compartments was estimated from the data. This was based on an analytical solution for the change in drug concentration arising from a series of transit compartments with the same first-order transfer rate between each compartment. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by the decrease in objective function value (OFV) and by inspection of diagnostic graphs. Results: With the TRANSIT model, the OFV was significantly lower and the goodness-of-fit was markedly improved in the absorption phase compared with the LAG model for all drugs. The parameter estimates related to the absorption differed between the two models while the estimates of the pharmacokinetic disposition parameters were similar. Conclusion: Based on these results, the TRANSIT model is an attractive alternative for modeling drug absorption delay, especially when a LAG model poorly describes the drug absorption phase or is numerically unstable.},

Routinely available clinical observations will be used to predict the parameters of a pharmacokinetic model, and subsequent blood level determinations used to refine these predictions, so that dosages can be designed to produce therapeutically desirable blood levels of agents. The system is intended to deal with most, if not all, of the influences on drug pharmacokinetics, to improve its performance by learning about the individual patient as well as the underlying population, and to modify its suggestions for an individual, should his clinical characteristics change. It may be used to discover new relationships between physiological states and drug pharmacokinetics. The system can exploit prior information in the form of theoretical and published data when its data base is small. An encouraging preliminary test of the system is reported.},

Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

Using two {SARS}-{CoV}-2 datasets of viral load starting within 7 days of symptoms, we fitted the slope-intercept exponential decay ({SI}), reduced target cell limited ({rTCL}), target cell limited ({TCL}) and {TCL} with eclipse phase ({TCLE}) models using nlmixr. Model performance was assessed via Bayesian information criterion ({BIC}), visual predictive checks ({VPCs}), goodness-of-fit plots, and parameter precision.

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated {SAEM} and {FOCEi}'s performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Method Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots. The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between {SAEM} and {FOCEi} using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. Results The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status. Under the fasted state, the first-order absorption into the central compartment was preceded by zero-order infusion into the depot compartment, whereas for the fed state, the absorption into the depot was instantaneous followed by first-order absorption from depot into the central compartment. The means of relative mean estimation error ({rMEE}) ( {MEESAEMMEEFOCEi}) and {rRMSE} ( {RMSESAEMRMSEFOCEi}) were 0.48 and 0.35, respectively. All parameter estimates given by {SAEM} appeared to be narrowly distributed and were close to the true value used for simulation. In contrast, the distribution of estimates from {FOCEi} were skewed and more biased. When initial estimates were perturbed, {FOCEi} estimates were more biased and imprecise. Discussion nlmixr is reliable for {NLMEM}. {SAEM} was superior to {FOCEi} in terms of bias and precision, and more robust against initial estimate perturbations.},
